## **How Can We Collaborate?**

Here’s the step-by-step plan:

1. **Profile & Setup (My Role)**

   * I’ll create and manage **US-based professional profiles**.
   * I’ll handle **bank details, background checks, and logistics**.
   * I’ll schedule recruiter calls and job opportunities for us.

2. **Interviews (Your Role)**

   * You’ll attend interviews based on your **English fluency and technical expertise**.
   * Each call will be a chance to showcase your skills and move closer to securing a role.
   * For your time, I’ll pay **per passed interview**:

     * Screening call: **\$20/hour**
     * Technical call: **\$40/hour**

3. **Getting the First Job**

   * With consistency, we can secure a contract within **1–2 months**.
   * Once you land a role, you’ll earn **\$1,500 per job**.
   * If you can also handle the development side, you’ll earn **\$3,000 per job**. If not, I’ll hire a developer and you still get **\$1,500 per job**.

4. **Scaling Up**

   * After the first success, we’ll target **3–4 contracts in parallel**, similar to how my co-worker currently works.
   * This means you’ll realistically earn **\$4,500–\$12,000 per month**, depending on your involvement in development.
