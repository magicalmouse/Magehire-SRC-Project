## **How Can We Collaborate?**

Here’s the step-by-step plan:

1. **Profile & Setup (My Role)**

   * I’ll create and manage **US-based professional profiles**.

   * I’ll schedule recruiter calls and job opportunities for us.

2. **Interviews (Your Role)**

   * Each call will be a chance to showcase your skills and move closer to securing a role.
   * For your time, I’ll pay **\$25/hour for all interview calls** you handle.

3. **Getting the First Job**

   * With consistency, we can secure a contract within **1–2 months**.
   * Once you land a role, you’ll earn **at least \$2,000 per job**.

4. **Scaling Up**
